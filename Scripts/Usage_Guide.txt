The usage of InFluence is as follows:

Installation:

1. Download the params.py, common_functions.py, InFluence.py, plot_trajectories.py, save_trajectories.py, and requirements.txt files 
2. Set up a virtual environment using the requirements.txt file. 

Running the scripts:
The only file that ever needs to heavily modified is the params.py file. Minor changes can be made to the other scripts, but are largely unnecessary. 

1. Edit the params.py file to suit your experiment (i.e. change beam energies, counting threshold, material properties). Add the path to the unmodulated image that you wish to modulate. For InFluence_fast, you need there is an additional line for pointing to the sample_distribution_file. This is used to save trajectories in save_trajectories.py and to load them in InFluence_fast.py.
2. Modulate the image by running InFluence_fast.py. Parallel mode can be enabled by setting parallel = True in the jit decorator. Set parallel = False to disable parallel mode. 
3. Run plot_trajectories.py to visualise the trajectories of the electrons and to generate a distribution of their final positions. Changes to the aesthetics of the plot can be made if desired.
Note that InFluence_fast.py, save_trajectories.py and plot_trajectories.py both use the same params.py file, so caution should be taken when using the plot_trajectories.py as Matplotlib can only handle a few thousand trajectories.
Of course, this can be avoided if you make a separate params.py file for each script, but the imports at the top of each scripts must be adjusted if this is done.
